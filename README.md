# Covid19-CV-Model
Deep learning project for classifying chest X-ray images (COVID-19, Pneumonia, Normal) using CNN and Kaggle dataset.
# 🦠 COVID-19 Chest X-ray Classification using Computer Vision

This project applies deep learning and computer vision techniques to classify chest X-ray images as COVID-19, Viral Pneumonia, Lung Opacity, or Normal. The model was trained on real-world medical imaging data to support automated diagnosis.

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset is sourced from Kaggle:  
[COVID-19 Radiography Database](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tawsifurrahman/covid19-radiography-database)  
It contains over 21,000 chest X-ray images categorized into four classes:
- COVID-19
- Viral Pneumonia
- Lung Opacity
- Normal
