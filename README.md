# Covid19-CV-Model
Deep learning project for classifying chest X-ray images (COVID-19, Pneumonia, Normal) using CNN and Kaggle dataset.
# 🦠 COVID-19 Chest X-ray Classification using Computer Vision

This project applies deep learning and computer vision techniques to classify chest X-ray images as COVID-19, Viral Pneumonia, Lung Opacity, or Normal. The model was trained on real-world medical imaging data to support automated diagnosis.
